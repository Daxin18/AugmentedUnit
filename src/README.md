# This is where the actual game files go

## Where to find stuff?

Everything that is an asset (image, sound etc.) goes to the [assets folder](./assets/).

All of the __commonly used scenes__ (aka levels/player/common components) have [their own folder](./scenes/) for easy access.

Files containing constant values/settings and things like that can be found in [settings folder](./settings/), again, for easy access.

Enything else (like scripts, small components, etc.) goes to the [components folder](./components/).

## Rules

Everything should be organized into properly named folders, so the path to any given thing will be relatively long, but (hopefully) easy to find

There's no definition for what is a "commonly used scene", we'll do our best to organize it, but will make mistakes, and if we do... well, tough luck.
