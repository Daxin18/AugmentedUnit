# Augmented Unit

A project for game development course at WUST. All the documentation is written in ___Polish___ as it was couldn't make it in English if we wanted to pass.

All of the game sounds and subtitles will also be in ___Polish___ for the same reason.

We might add an option to change the language if we have enough time left.

For now, if you speak ___Polish___ please, feel free to check out the documentation containing the [GDD](/docs/Augmented%20Unit%20-%20GDD.md) and all the requirements for each stage of the project ([initial version of GDD](/docs/requirements/GK%20lista%201_%20Szczegółowy%20projekt%20(GDD).pdf), [First playable](docs/requirements/GK%20lista%202_%20First%20playable.pdf), [Alpha](docs/requirements/GK%20lista%203_%20Alpha.pdf), [Beta](docs/requirements/GK%20lista%204_%20Beta.pdf), [Gold master](docs/requirements/GK%20lista%205_%20%20Gold%20master.pdf)).
